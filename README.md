# Evolutionary Computing

This repo has installed evolutionary multitasking algorithms to solve TSP, Knapsack, icdpu problems. 

The installed algorithms are GA, DE, MFEA, OTMTO
Original OTMTO method paper references link: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359324199_Orthogonal_Transfer_for_Multitask_Optimization

## How to run
Checkout the test.jpynb for running code

## More settings
In our implementation, we intalled various representation method for the problems: Real-value, permutation, binning, icdpu
